      <description>Hi, there. This is ExhYZ. As we increasingly rely on artificial intelligence in various aspects of our lives, it&amp;rsquo;s essential to consider the potential environmental impacts of these technologies. The use of AI could cause a lot of social problems and we may need to be aware of them and perhaps change some of our thinking. If you want to learn about these or get some of our development ideas and spirits, please be patient and read through this post.</description>
